	  <h1>DISPLIB: Train Dispatching benchmark library</h2>
    <p>
    Given a set of trains traveling on a railway, the
    <strong>Train Dispatching Problem</strong> is the operational problem
    that occurs when some trains have become delayed with respect  
    to their prescribed timetable, and we want to make routing 
    and scheduling adjustments to minimize the total delay on the railway.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are currently working on a problem definition, file format, and
      collecting problem instances from railways around the world to 
      allow researchers and engineers to better compare and benchmark their
      algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <strong>DISPLIB competition</strong> is scheduled to start September 2024. Check back then!
